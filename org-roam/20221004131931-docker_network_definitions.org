| bridge \vert docker0 | Default Docker virtual network, which is NAT'ed behind the host IP                           |
| host                 | It gains performance by skypping virtual networks but sacrifices security of container model |
| none                 | Removes eth0 and only leaves you with localhost interface in container                       |
