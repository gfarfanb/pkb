#+title: Imperative vs. Declarative

| Imperative  | Focus on /how/ a program operates           |
| Declarative | Focus on /what/ a program should accomplish |

Example: I'd like a cup of coffee
- Imperative: I boil water, scoop out 42 grams of medium-fine grounds, poor over 700 grams of water, etc.
- Declarative: Barista, I'd like a cup of coffee (Barista is the engine that works through the steps, including retrying to make a cup, and is only finished when I have a cup)
