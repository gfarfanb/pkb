- [ ] Better *Isolation*:  The servers can have installed different versions of the same platform and the same system without any conflict and without dealing with OSs
- [ ] Reduce *Environment* variances: Every part of the app for every type of environment requires a diffenrent configuration/dependencies/versions so Docker guarantees just what you need to run regardless the environment
  - Containers reduce the complexity of the "Matrix from Hell"
