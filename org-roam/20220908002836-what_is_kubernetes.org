- Kubernetes is a set of choices that come together to form the control plane.
- These are the system parts of the Kubernetes:
  1. Kubernetes (K8s or Kube: The whole orchestration system
  2. Kubectl (cube control): CLI to configure Kubernetes and manage apps
  3. Node: Single server in the Kubernetes cluster
  4. Kubelet: Kubernetes agent running or nodes
  5. Control Plane (master): Set of containers that manage the cluster. Includes API server, schedule, controller manager, etcd (distributed storage system for key-values) and more.
- Other pieces have no default and require choosing from [[id:7b5ce675-6787-47f3-be85-52f486e78501][many industry options]], like container runtime, networking, and ingress proxy
(there are some vanilla upstream Kubernetes on GitHub you can try before to choose a vendor distribution).
- Some of the more important abstractions for Kubernetes are:
  1. Pod: it's the basic unit of deployment. One or more containers running together on one node
  2. Controller: For creating/updating pods and other objects (Deployment, ReplicaSet, StafeulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob)
  3. Service: network endpoint to connect to a pod
  4. Namespace: Filtered group of objects in cluster
  5. Secrets, ConfigMaps, etc.
