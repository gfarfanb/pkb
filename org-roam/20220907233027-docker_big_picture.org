Docker can be defined by the following *Build, Ship and Run* lifecycle:
1. Images: It aids you in packaging an application (with all its dependencies).
1. Registries: It helps to distribute that app around to all the places you need to run it.
1. Containers: It runs that app in a highly reproducible way.
