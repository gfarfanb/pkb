#+title: SOLID Programming Principles of OOP

| Principle             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Responsibility | Revolves around the claim that a certain code module (most often, a class) should only have responsibility over one part of the functionality provided by the software. The module should only have one reason to change.                                                     |
| Open Closed           | Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Liskov Substitution   | In a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.). |
| Interface Segregation | Your interface should not be bloated with methods that implementing classes don't require.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Dependency Inversion  | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.                                                                                                                                                                                |
